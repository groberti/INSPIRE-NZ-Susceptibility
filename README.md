# INSPIRE-NaturalRiskZone-SusceptibilityExtension
An extension to the INSPIRE Natural Risk Zone Schema to include Susceptibility Area as a feature type.  

Susceptibility is the spatial probability of natural hazard occurence.

The concept of susceptibility is mentioned in the INSPIRE data specifications for Natural Risk Zones, yet the concept is not implemented as a feature type. 
This Extension is based off the [Natural Risk Zones Core Schema ](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas/nz-core/4.0/). Two Feature Types 

## Usage
This schema extension can be used with ETL tools to align hazard susceptibily maps and database.

## Acknowledgments
This schema extension has been developed by Minerva Intelligence as a part of the INSPIRE Helsinki 2019 Data Challenge.
